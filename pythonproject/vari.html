<h1 align="center">variables</h1>
<h4>In Python, a variable is a named storage location that holds a value. It acts as a symbolic name for a value, making it easier to reference and manipulate data in your program. Unlike some other programming languages, in Python, you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable; the interpreter infers the type based on the value assigned to it.</h4>
<h4>Here's a simple example:</h4>
<p  ># Variable assignment<br>
x = 10<br>
 
# Printing the value of the variable<br>
print(x)
</p>
<h2 style="color:yellowgreen;">Python variable naming rules:</h2>
<h4><ul><li>Variable names are case-sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables).</li>
<li>Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.</li>
<li>Variable names cannot start with a number.</li>
<li>Python has some reserved words (keywords) that cannot be used as variable names because they have special meanings in the language.</li></h4>
<p># Valid variable names<br>
my_variable = 42<br>
user_input = "Hello, World!"<br>

# Invalid variable names (due to starting with a number)<br>
1st_variable = 5
