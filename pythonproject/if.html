<h1 align="center">Conditional statements</h1>
<p >Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions in your code based on certain conditions. The most commonly used conditional statements are if, else, and elif (short for "else if").</p>
<h2>if statement</h2>
<h4>The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is True.</h4>
<p class="one">x = 10<br>

if x > 5:<br>
    print("x is greater than 5")
</p>
<h2>if else statement</h2>

<h4>The else statement is used to execute a block of code if the if condition is False.</h4>
<p class="one">x = 3<br>

if x > 5:<br>
    print("x is greater than 5")<br>
else:<br>
    print("x is not greater than 5")
 </p>
 <h2>if elif else statement</h2>
 <h4>The elif statement allows you to check multiple conditions. It is used when you have more than one condition to check.</h4>
 <p class="one">x = 5<br>

if x > 5:<br>
    print("x is greater than 5")<br>
elif x < 5:<br>
    print("x is less than 5")<br>
else:<br>
    print("x is equal to 5")
</p>
